I am a first year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, advised by <a href="https://swarunkumar.com/">Prof. Swarun Kumar</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~justinc3/">Prof. Justin Chan</a>. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of wireless sensing and human health. With recent advancements in antenna and microphone technology, especially in their sensitivity, I am excited about the potential of these devices to monitor bodily functions and diagnose diseases. I am also interested in smart home applications and the capabilities of machine learning within the wireless sensing community.
